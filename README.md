### Hi there 👋

As a junior data scientist, I am a creative and detail-oriented individual with a passion for mathematics, science, and problem-solving. 

My educational background in engineering has provided me with a strong foundation in creating and optimizing systems that have a positive impact on communities. 

My focus has been on developing cities in a way that benefits the people who live in them, using data-driven solutions to tackle real-life problems.
